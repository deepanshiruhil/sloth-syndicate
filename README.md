SLOTH ü¶•

wreckathon submission (probably gonna lose but whatever)

ok so we made this thing called SLOTH and honestly it's the dumbest app ever but that's kinda the point???

basically everyone's obsessed with being productive and we were like "what if we made an app that actively makes you LESS productive" and then we stayed up for 30 hours straight building it while consuming unhealthy amounts of red bull

what it does (spoiler: nothing useful)

you try to add a task
it suggests you do literally anything else instead
there's a spinning vortex thing that looks cool but serves no purpose
a sloth judges your life choices
demotivational quotes because regular motivation is overrated
it tracks how much you're NOT accomplishing (revolutionary metrics)
the whole thing is basically a to-do app but engineered specifically to prevent you from doing things. we're honestly not sure if this is genius or if we've just lost our minds

tech stuff

react, tailwind, bunch of other things. we probably over-engineered this considering it's basically a joke app but here we are

spent way too much time making custom sloth-themed css variables and honestly we're not even sorry

how to run this mess

git clone [whatever the repo is]
npm install
npm run dev
# congrats you're now part of the problem
why did we build this

good question. it was 2am, we had too much caffeine, and someone said "you know what the world needs? an app that makes you worse at life"

also we're procrastinating on our actual assignments so this felt... meta?

demo

there's supposed to be a demo video here but we used our own app and never made one. the irony is not lost on us. jk here's a demo because the organizers demanded one Watch it here

"business model"

step 1: make app that prevents productivity step 2: ??? step 3: probably bankruptcy but with style

testimonials

"this app ruined my life in the best way possible" - anonymous user (probably us)

"i was supposed to submit my thesis today. instead i spent 4 hours customizing my procrastination settings" - grad student somewhere

bugs/features

sometimes the sloth judges you too harshly (working as intended)
the vortex is mildly hypnotic (also working as intended)
occasionally suggests actually doing work (this is a bug, we're working on it)
team

a bunch of sleep-deprived college students who thought this was a good idea at 3am. we're still not sure if we were right or if we've collectively lost our minds

hackathon requirements (because we actually read the rules)

starred the github thing: https://github.com/YosemiteCrew/Yosemite-Crew ‚úì
filled out the form: https://forms.gle/8X858WzLumMTHQXz6 ‚úì
everyone on the team did both things because we're chaotic but not stupid ‚úì
final thoughts

we spent way too much time on this for something that's supposed to be useless. the real procrastination was the friends we made along the way.

if you actually use this app and it ruins your life, that's on you. we warned you.

built during wreckathon '25 with coffee, poor life choices, and the distant sound of our actual responsibilities crying

peace out ‚úåÔ∏è
